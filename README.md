# Persinterest

We all share similar interests one way or another. A team of three students from Google CSSI Detroit 2019 decided to take that statement and create an application.

This webapp is focused on allowing users to sign in / sign up, take a personality test, then find interests for that person. Our goal was to build a unique 'True Color' test application that was simple and easy to navigate through.
